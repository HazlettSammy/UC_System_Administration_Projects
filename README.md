This repository contains the projects I completed during the System Administration course, which focused on hands-on system administration tasks using CentOS 7 and Windows Server. Throughout the course, I gained practical experience in configuring, managing, and troubleshooting both Linux and Windows server environments. I worked on various labs that covered user management, service configuration, security implementation, and system monitoring on CentOS 7. For Windows Server, I explored key features such as Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, and virtualization with CECH Sandbox, an in-house VM software replacing Hyper-V for virtualization tasks. By the end of the course, I developed essential skills in managing server infrastructures, preparing me for real-world IT environments.
